# `calibrate_debounce`

A utility to calibrate the debounce delay for a mechanical switch (e.g., a
tactile/button switch).

## Circuit

This program expects an Arduino-compatible board with internal pull-up
resistors (i.e., digital pin mode `INPUT_PULLUP` supported), with the following
connections:

    Digital pin `kPinSwitch` ---- switch ---- ground

## How to build

### Option 1: Use the Arduino IDE

I've never done this before, so you're on your own :-)

### Option 2: Use the Makefile

If you are using an Arduino Unoâ€“compatible board, simply run

    make

to compile the program, and then

    make upload

to flash your controller.

The heavy lifting is done by
[Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile), so
if you are using a non-Uno board, you will need to supply the build arguments
`BOARD_TAG` and `BOARD_SUB` as described in the Arduino-Makefile documentation.
For example:

    make BOARD_TAG=atmegang BOARD_SUB=atmega168
    make upload

Note that Arduino-Makefile depends on (the Arduino core libraries and)
pySerial.

## How to use

Slowly toggle the switch, and inspect the resulting serial printout.  I'd
recommend waiting at least 2 seconds between toggles.  (Printouts are held
in memory for 1 second before printing, so if the toggle time is less than
that, printouts will be lost.)

We define a "streak" to be a span of at least `kSteadyThresholdUsec`
microseconds during which the digital input has consistently read the same
value.  Shortly after the end of each streak, a message like the following
is printed to serial:

    Streak with value 0 started at timestamp 19496560 usec and ended at time 21879656 usec
    Time between streaks = 0 usec (+/- approx 8 usec)

More example outputs:

    Streak with value 0 started at timestamp 19496560 usec and ended at time 21879656 usec
    Time between streaks = 0 usec (+/- approx 8 usec)
    Streak with value 1 started at timestamp 21880396 usec and ended at time 24318016 usec
    Time between streaks = 740 usec (+/- approx 12 usec)
    Streak with value 0 started at timestamp 24318016 usec and ended at time 26807016 usec
    Time between streaks = 0 usec (+/- approx 12 usec)

The error term (`+/- approx __ usec`) is the amount of time between
consecutive reads (i.e., consecutive executions of `loop()`).
